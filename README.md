Country Capital Matching App

You are given a key, value pair of countries. You need to suffle them display as array of buttons.

(e.g) { 'usa': 'new york', 'germany': 'berlin', 'india': 'new delhi', 'uk': 'london' }

Whenever you're click the first button, the background should be changed to blue color. When you click the second button if it matched with the previous button, both of them should be removed from the button array. If they are not paired with eachother the button color should be turned to red color. When you click the next button, you need to change the previously clicked buttons color to white, if they are in red color. Once you successfully clicked all matched button, when there are no button left, you should display a message "Congratulations!".
